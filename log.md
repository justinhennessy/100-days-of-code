# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**

My first day has begun with research and I suspect the first week or 2 is going to be the same.

I have been working my way through the [Machine learning for humans](https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans/why-machine-learning-matters-6164faf1df12) blog post (I downloaded the PDF). As I am a complete noob, I wanted to get across all the different types of learning. Today was all about supervised learning, here are some tid bits.

There are two main tasks for supervised learning:

- regression (ie how much will a house sell for)
- categorisation (ie cat or dog)

Under the umbrealla of regression there are a few methods

`linear regressions` (ordinary least square, OLS), predict a continuous numerical value, tries and predicts a value Y given a previous unseen value of X. Within this topic there was discussion of `Gradient Descent`, the goal of which is to find the minimum of a model’s loss function by iteratively getting a better and better approximation of it. Machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow use it in the background everywhere, so it’s worth understanding the details.


`logistic regression` a method of classification which outputs the probability of a target Y belonging to a certain class

It also discussed a concept of `overfitting`, which essentially means, the model matches the training data exactly so losses its ability to "predict" or learning for things it hasn't seen.

Two ways to combat overfitting:

1. Use more training data. The more you have, the harder it is to overfit.

2. Use regularization. Add in a penalty in the loss function for building a model.

**Thoughts:**

I have decided to take up the 100 day of coding challenge with a focus on Machine Learning.

From a very early age, AI and Machine Learning has been a fascination and something I thought would only ever be a thing of fantasy. With the barrier to entry being so low now and with an abundance of tooling to help not only learn but execute, the time is ripe.

I would like to thank Daniel Bourke and Angela Baltes (part of my Linkedin network) for their guidance and patience to help me at the very beginning of my journey, this humble student appreciates the time you have given to help me on this journey to date.

So a challenge is not one without a goal, so here goes, I am committing that in 100 days, I will have built my first custom learning model and have run a real-world experiment with it.

I have some ideas on where I might start to give myself a little more focus but I will vet these ideas first, then commit to a particular use case in the coming weeks.
