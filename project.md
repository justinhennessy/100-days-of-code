# My first ML project

## Summary

I thought it would be interesting to find a topic that is both interesting and useful in a professional capcity so will be looking to see if I can build a profile and start understaning the attributes of a customer that has (or is likely) to churn (ie leave) a product of service.

This is understanding is highly important to all businesses and to even get a small insight into whether a customer is likely to churn or not could have huge impacts for businesses.

The goal of this project is to build a model that describes a potentially churning customer and highlights them to be proactively connected.

## The plan

- do a bunch of research on what customer churn is, what is the common psychology behind it and the common attributes and behaviour that one should look for
- use real world data and interview business personnel to get a feel for what the business see as attributes of a churning customer
- identify where I can get all the relevant data
- see if we can get regular access to that data so we can do updates
- collate the data for processing
- build a model with a heap of assumptions and training it
